# Smart-Dustbin-Using-Arduino

Smart bins are an intelligent waste management system. They have wireless ultrasonic fill-level sensors embedded inside which detect how full the bin is and then, through the IoT, this data is sent to a cloud-based monitoring and analytics platform.Smart bin not only makes waste collection and handling extremely convenient but also helps in maintaining a garbage-free and sustainable environment for the public. The system of waste collection and the optimized route offered by smart bins eliminate the risk of overflowing along with minimizing the CO2 emission.
